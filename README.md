# CTF Tracker 

A simple web app I built to keep track of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions I’ve participated in. It helps me stay organized and see how I’m improving over time.

## About the Project

This project started because I wanted an easier way to log my CTFs — the date, name, platform, category, score, and any notes or writeups. Instead of keeping everything in random documents or spreadsheets, I made this app so I could manage it all in one place.

It's built to run entirely in the browser — no signups, no servers, no databases. Just open the file and it works.

## Features

- Add and edit entries for each CTF
- Filter and sort entries by date, points, category, etc.
- View stats and graphs to track progress visually
- Clean and responsive layout with multiple theme options
- All data is stored in your browser (locally)

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
2. Use the "Add Entry" tab to start logging
3. Switch to "View Entries" or "Graphs & Stats" to manage and review your data
4. Go to "Settings" to change the theme or optionally enter a GitHub token (not required)
